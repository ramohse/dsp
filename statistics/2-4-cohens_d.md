[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>>*The difference in mean weight between first babies and subsequent babies is: -0.12 lbs, or  -1.7%  of the mean weight of all births.*  
>>*The Cohen's d effect-size measure of first birth size vs. others is -0.09 standard deviations, slightly larger in magnitude than the effect first births have on length of pregnancy (0.029 std devs), but still small.*
